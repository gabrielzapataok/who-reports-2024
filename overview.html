                <h2 class="title-section text-grey text-center mb-20">Introduction</h2>
                <p>WHO is marking its 75th anniversary this year, with its 194 Member States and partners, by calling for a renewed drive for health equity. The past seven and a half decades have seen extraordinary progress in protecting people from diseases, health risks and harms. However, as this report shows, further progress is needed to achieve the triple billion targets towards attaining the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and meeting other health challenges, such as mental health, antimicrobial resistance and climate change.
                    <br><br>
                    Five years ago WHO set out to enhance its focus on measurable impacts in countries, with the Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019–2023 (GPW 13),  which was subsequently extended to 2025. During this time, the Organization set measurable triple billion targets based on the Sustainable Development Goals; established a results framework to measure country progress and identify the contribution of the Secretariat; reported annually using the framework; launched delivery stock takes to track progress and identify ways for the Secretariat to provide support to countries using specific indicators; developed and revised the first WHO investment case; and continue to help countries to accelerate progress through scaling up innovation, innovative financing, and strengthening collaboration among multilateral agencies.
                    <br><br>
                    This mid-term review of implementation of the Programme budget 2022–2023 presents the progress in 2022 towards the triple billion targets, outcomes and outputs, based on the GPW 13 results framework, which includes indicators. As various evaluations have recommended simplifying the output monitoring process, this report includes progress on deliverables planned for the biennium with the main results that have emerged in the first year of the biennium as reported by the output delivery teams,  leaving the more extensive programmatic assessment using the output scorecard for the end of biennium. In addition, key accomplishments are highlighted based on a selection by senior management and selected impact case studies are presented to exemplify how the Secretariat and Member States work together to drive health impacts at the country level, where it matters most.

                <p>The indicators for healthier populations are influenced by multisectoral policy actions to address determinants of health. Substantial progress has been made, and the current trajectory indicates that this target will likely be met by 2025; however, this will be insufficient progress to be on track to reach the related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. For example, the global age-standardized prevalence of tobacco use remains high. The prevalence of adult obesity continues to be on the rise in all WHO regions, with no immediate sign of reversal. Air pollution has not been tackled in many areas of the world. Data from the pandemic period continue to be sparse, so the full extent of the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on various health determinants and policies is not yet quantified.</p>

        <!--  Programme budget financing and implementation -->

                <h2 class="text-center title-section pb-40"> Programme budget financing and implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    In May 2022, the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA75.5 on revision of the Programme budget 2022‒2023, in which it further approved the increase in the base budget segment of the Programme budget 2022–2023, as approved in resolution WHA74.3 (2021). Through resolution WHA75.5, the total Programme budget now stands at US$ 6726.1 million for the financial period 2022–2023.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At the end of the first year of the biennium the total Programme budget had a good level of financing, including projections (US$ 8.3 billion), which surpassed the total approved budget (see Table 1). The good level of financing is explained by two event-driven budget segments: emergency operations and appeals, and polio eradication, the financing for which has needed to exceed the amounts established in the Programme budget in order to keep step with operational needs.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Base programmes, representing the core work of the Organization, also had good financing levels for this time in the biennium: 87% when projected voluntary contributions were included. Despite these positive figures, as at 31 December 2022, the base programmes had a funding gap of US$ 660 million, after including projections of voluntary contributions. The current gap is compounded by the challenge of persisting pockets of poverty – underscoring the urgent need for more sustainable financing.

            <p>
                The level of financing achieved so far has only been possible thanks to the generosity of Member States and other stakeholders (see Fig.1). The Secretariat greatly appreciates this commitment to WHO and notes the importance of maintaining and increasing the flexibility and predictability of the funds allocated to the Organization, and to strengthening the financing of the Organization’s core work as approved in WHO’s base programmes.
                <br>
                <br>
                At 38% (Table 1), levels of utilization of the budget for base programmes were lower than expected (50%) at the end of the first year of the biennium and appeared to be strongly linked with financing levels and time of arrival of funds. Utilization rates were on target when compared against available funding. In the current situation, when a large majority of the base budget segment is financed from specified voluntary contributions, the utilization challenge remains in chronically underfunded areas even if otherwise they have capacity to implement the budget.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Secretariat relies on the support of its Member States and other stakeholders to fill the remaining gap with increased efforts to mobilize more timely and flexible funding, which would also help to overcome persisting pockets of poverty and ensure a high rate of implementation of the Programme budget by the end of the biennium.
                <br>
