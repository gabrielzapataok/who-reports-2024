            <div class="country-content-body">
                <p>In Papua New Guinea, gaps in health information workforce capacity remain a challenge at the national
                    and sub-national levels. To address them, WHO Papua New Guinea collaborated with the National
                    Department of Health (NDoH) to develop a standard set of competencies needed for data-related roles
                    at the national and provincial levels. This initiative resulted in the government's adoption of the
                    competency profiles, serving as a milestone in systematic and sustainable capacity building. With
                    the profiles now defined, targeted actions are being taken to develop training needs assessment
                    tools and long-term capacity building plans based on the competencies. Future capacity building
                    activities will be implemented according to the competencies required for specific roles, rather
                    than ad-hoc or donor-driven approaches. These efforts are expected to contribute to increasing
                    Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Papua New Guinea.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align:center;">How did Papua New Guinea, with the support of the WHO Secretariat,
                    achieve this?</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In Papua New Guinea, there is a shortage of adequate and skilled health information workers at both
                    the national and sub-national levels. This hampers the timely production, processing, analysis, and
                    use of quality data, which is essential for improving health outcomes. To address this challenge,
                    the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Strategic Plan for the country's 2021 to 2030 National
                    Health Plan incorporated capacity building in M&amp;E and health information [1]. The aim is to
                    equip Papua New Guinea’s health workforce with the necessary skills to undertake data management,
                    analysis, and data quality assessments. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>A competency-based approach, which is oriented around the ability of health workers to effectively
                    combine their knowledge, skills, and attitudes in practice, is regarded as an effective way of
                    systematically building capacity. To support countries in their quest for UHC, WHO has a&nbsp; <a

                        collaborated with the NDoH in August 2022 to define competencies for three different health
                        information roles at the national and provincial levels, including in hospitals. This involved
                        mapping health information roles, analyzing the job descriptions of provincial health
                        information officers, medical records officers, and M&amp;E officers at the NDoH, interviewing
                        officers to gain an improved understanding of their roles and responsibilities, and consulting
                        with relevant stakeholders. This initiative generated productive conversations on capacity
                        building plans, career pathways, and the significance of health information roles in Provincial
                        Health Authorities.</p>

                    <p>In October 2022, WHO Papua New Guinea collaborated with the NDoH to host a national health
                        information workshop. During the workshop, the draft competency profiles developed for health
                        information roles at the provincial level were thoroughly reviewed and adopted by the government
                        of Papua New Guinea. The NDoH, with technical assistance from WHO Papua New Guinea, is currently
                        formulating capacity-building plans based on the identified competency profiles, to enable
                        targeted action. </p>

                    <p>To successfully develop competency profiles, it was essential to understand the context of health
                        system integration to be able to focus on building and preserving capacity in the long-term. To
                        ensure this was done effectively, a backcasting approach was needed. This involved looking ahead
                        and analyzing future health information needs and competencies. A participatory approach
                        involving all stakeholders in health information in the country was necessary to ensure that all
                        needs were identified. This allowed the changes in data needs and skills to be understood, and
                        the team gained lessons from these changes. WHO Papua New Guinea continues to provide technical
                        support to the country to ensure that health information systems are fit for purpose and that
                        capacity building is at the heart of health information management.</p>
